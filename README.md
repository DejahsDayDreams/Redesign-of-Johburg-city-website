I was recently developing a new and enhanced website for the city of Johannesburg using Visual Studio's ASP.net templates. 
This project had numerous goals, including ensuring the website's security following a hacking attack in 2019, 
moving current material from the old website, and establishing new pages to improve user experience. In addition, 
the two feedback forms be implemented on the homepage, which would save user input to a database. 
Throughout this project, I used my web development talents to achieve these objectives while also improving the functionality and usability 
of the website.

Challenges and Implementation:

To develop the new website, the first big step was to change the ASP.net templates.
I began by carefully examining and transferring the existing content from the old website (https://www.joburg.org.za/) to the new site. 
This entailed developing the following key pages: the home page, a "About the city" page, a "City services" page, and a "Key documents" page.
These sections were created to give people quick access to important information about Johannesburg.
Improving website security to prevent future hacking events was one of the most crucial parts of this project. To do this, 
I put in place strong security measures, such as updating all software components, putting in place a Web Application Firewall (WAF), 
and routinely checking for vulnerabilities. In addition, I made certain that all user inputs were verified and sanitized to prevent any 
injection attacks.

The most difficult aspect of this project was putting the feedback forms on the homepage. These forms were created to collect user feedback 
and complaints and save them to a database called "dbUserFeedback." To accomplish this, I separated the database into two tables: 
"tblComplaint" and "tblCompliment." Each form requested information from the user, such as their name, email address, phone number, 
and the subject of their comments. To ensure data integrity and security, database interactions required careful coding.

I was recently developing a new and enhanced website for the city of Johannesburg using Visual Studio's ASP.net templates. 
This project had numerous goals, including ensuring the website's security following a hacking attack in 2019, 
moving current material from the old website, and establishing new pages to improve user experience. In addition, 
the two feedback forms be implemented on the homepage, which would save user input to a database. 
Throughout this project, I used my web development talents to achieve these objectives while also improving the functionality and usability 
of the website.

Challenges and Implementation:

To develop the new website, the first big step was to change the ASP.net templates.
I began by carefully examining and transferring the existing content from the old website (https://www.joburg.org.za/) to the new site. 
This entailed developing the following key pages: the home page, a "About the city" page, a "City services" page, and a "Key documents" page.
These sections were created to give people quick access to important information about Johannesburg.
Improving website security to prevent future hacking events was one of the most crucial parts of this project. To do this, 
I put in place strong security measures, such as updating all software components, putting in place a Web Application Firewall (WAF), 
and routinely checking for vulnerabilities. In addition, I made certain that all user inputs were verified and sanitized to prevent any 
injection attacks.

The most difficult aspect of this project was putting the feedback forms on the homepage. These forms were created to collect user feedback 
and complaints and save them to a database called "dbUserFeedback." To accomplish this, I separated the database into two tables: 
"tblComplaint" and "tblCompliment." Each form requested information from the user, such as their name, email address, phone number, 
and the subject of their comments. To ensure data integrity and security, database interactions required careful coding.


Throughout the development of the new Johannesburg website, one of the critical aspects of the project was the implementation of feedback forms on the homepage. These forms were designed to allow users to submit complaints and compliments, a valuable feature for promoting civic engagement. However, due to the project's time constraints, there were limitations on the extent to which the database tables could be populated with real-world user feedback.
Given the project's scope and timeline, I took proactive measures to ensure that the functionality of the feedback forms and database integration was demonstrated effectively. To achieve this, I populated the tables with as much data as possible within the given timeframe. This included creating sample entries for both complaints and compliments, complete with fictitious names, email addresses, phone numbers, and feedback content.
It's important to note that while these sample entries showcase the intended functionality of the system, they do not represent genuine user feedback. The true value of such a feedback system lies in its ability to collect and display real user experiences, opinions, and suggestions. However, without an extension from the client to continue populating these tables with authentic user submissions, the database will primarily consist of these sample entries.
The decision to populate the tables to the best of our abilities within the given constraints was made to demonstrate the system's capabilities effectively. While the website now stands as a secure and functional platform, it is essential to recognize that its true potential in facilitating citizen feedback and engagement can only be fully realized with ongoing participation from the residents and visitors of Johannesburg. Therefore, we recommend that the client consider extending the project to allow for the accumulation of genuine user feedback, further enhancing the website's value to the community.
